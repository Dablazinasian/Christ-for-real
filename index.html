    <h2>Chapter 2</h2>
    <p>I know that we're all very busy. For some of y'all, this isn't your only book you're reading consistently. 
        So I want to encourage y'all to be highlighting or jotting down interesting points Price makes or verses that really tied everything together for you.</p>

    <div>Two passages that could be read alongside this chapter:
        <span style="display: block; margin: 0;">- Romans 7:7-25 OR</span>
        <span style="display: block; margin: 0;">- Ephesians 4:17-32</span>
    </div>

    <div>While reading Chapter 2, you might notice that it's very similar to chapter 1. Here are a few distinctions to focus on:
        <span style="display: block; margin: 0;">- Depth of Alienation: why does our failure exist</span>
        <span style="display: block; margin: 0;">- Glory of God: ultimate standard</span>
        <span style="display: block; margin: 0;">- Nothing is impossible: hopeful perspective</span>
    </div>

    <p>As you read the chapter, consider some ways that you can reflect God's character.</p>

    <div>A couple of examples:
        <span style="display: block; margin: 0;">- God's unseen presence in the mundane: God is always with us, even in routine tasks. 
            Reflect His character by quietly serving a family member without expecting any recognition.</span>
        <span style="display: block; margin: 0;">- God’s patience and purposefulness: God’s words are powerful yet restrained, showing patience and purpose. 
            Reflect His character by choosing silence and listening deeply rather than trying to fix or control situations with words.</span>
        <span style="display: block; margin: 0;">- God's unshakeable peace: God remains steady and unflustered, no matter the circumstances. 
            Reflect His character by anchoring yourself in faith, especially during stressful or uncertain times.</span>
        <span style="display: block; margin: 0;">- God's heart for justice and mercy: God seeks justice but tempers it with compassion and understanding. 
            Reflect His character by standing up for what is right in a way that also extends empathy and mercy.</span>
        <span style="display: block; margin: 0;">- God's steadfast joy: God’s joy transcends circumstances, flowing from His very nature. 
            Reflect His character by finding and expressing gratitude and joy, even in difficult seasons.</span>
