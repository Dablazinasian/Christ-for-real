    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Hey guys, to save space in the group chat I'm just writing everything on this deployed website. </p>
    <p>As we prepare our hearts for fellowship tomorrow and to dive into this book, I wanted us to think on just one question that I felt like would help our discussion.</p>
    <p>What is one specific temptation that you find most challenging in your walk with Christ?How has it affected your relationship with Him and your ability to lead your family spiritually?</p>
    <p>A couple of examples:</p>
    <p>- comfort/complacency</p>
    <p>- distractions</p>
    <p>- pride e.g. "I got this"</p>
