    <h2>Chapter 4</h2>
    <!--
    <p>I know that we're all very busy. For some of y'all, this isn't your only book you're reading consistently. 
        So I want to encourage y'all to be highlighting or jotting down interesting points Price makes or verses that really tied everything together for you.</p>

    <div>A passage that could be read alongside this chapter: Matthew 19:16-30</div>
    
    <!--
    <br>
    <div>While reading Chapter 2, you might notice that it's very similar to chapter 1. Here are a few distinctions to focus on:
        <span style="display: block; margin: 0;">- Depth of Alienation: why does our failure exist</span>
        <span style="display: block; margin: 0;">- Glory of God: ultimate standard</span>
        <span style="display: block; margin: 0;">- Nothing is impossible: hopeful perspective</span>
    </div>
    -->
    <p>As you read the chapter, consider how surrendering to Christ’s lordship might look in your everyday life.</p>

    <div>A couple of examples:
        <span style="display: block; margin: 0;">- Decisions: Instead of deciding based on personal preferences, pray for God’s guidance, trusting His direction.</span>
        <span style="display: block; margin: 0;">- Priorities: Reflect on areas where you may hold back from surrendering. Choose one area this week to yield fully to God.</span>
        <span style="display: block; margin: 0;">- Dependence: Practice letting go of self-reliance by inviting God’s help in daily tasks, viewing them as opportunities for faith growth.</span>
        <!--
        <span style="display: block; margin: 0;">- God's heart for justice</span>
        <span style="display: block; margin: 0;">- God's steadfast joy</span>
        -->
    </div>
