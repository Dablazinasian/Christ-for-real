    <h2>Chapter 4</h2>

    <div>A passage that could be read alongside this chapter: Matthew 19:16-30</div>

    <p>As you read the chapter, consider how surrendering to Christ’s lordship might look in your everyday life.</p>

    <div>A couple of examples:
        <span style="display: block; margin: 0;">- Decisions: Instead of deciding based on personal preferences, pray for God’s guidance, trusting His direction.</span>
        <span style="display: block; margin: 0;">- Priorities: Reflect on areas where you may hold back from surrendering. Choose one area this week to yield fully to God.</span>
        <span style="display: block; margin: 0;">- Dependence: Practice letting go of self-reliance by inviting God’s help in daily tasks, viewing them as opportunities for faith growth.</span>
