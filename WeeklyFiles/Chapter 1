    <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
    <p>I know that we're all very busy. For some of y'all, this isn't your only book you're reading consistently. 
        So I want to encourage y'all to be highlighting or jotting down interesting points Price makes or verses that really tied everything together for you.</p>
    <p>A passage that could be read alongside this chapter is Romans 7 (starting in verse 7 but might as well study the whole chapter).</p>
    <p>While reading Chapter 1, think about the difference between working for God and allowing God to work through you. 
        Consider how you might unknowingly rely on your own efforts rather than trusting in His power, and how that may have impacted your walk with Christ</p>
    <p>A couple of examples:</p>
    <p>- Serving in Church: Overserving and exhausting yourself may end up in neglecting prayer life.
        Contrastingly, prioritizing prayer means you can serve with peace, knowing you're a vessel for His work.</p>
    <p>- Leading the Family: Implementing a perfect family devotional/prayer routine or fixing every familial problem leads you feeling frustrated. 
        Contrastingly, you pray for wisdom and guidance in leading while also praying for your family and let God work in their hearts. </p>
    <p>- Career/Finances</p>
    <p>- Big life decisions</p>
    <p>- Anxiety</p>
